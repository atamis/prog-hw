How does a function definition look different from a variable definition?
     Surrounds the primary identfier with parentheses, and inside the parentheses, there are more secondary identifiers
What is a function header?  Give an example to show what function headers look like.
     It includes the define identifier, the primary identifers, and the arguments: (define (awesome thing)
What is a function body?  Where does it belong in a function definition?
      It is a single expression that comes after the function header and before the ending parenthesis.
Why would we define a function?  In other words, whatâ€™s the purpose of defining a function?
     To package code up into small bits that are easy to use, test, and maintain.
What is an argument?
     A specific value that a paremeter is assigned when the function is called.
What is a parameter?  How is it different from an argument?
     It is the "placeholder" or local binding that is set when the function is called.
