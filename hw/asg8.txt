Programming 1, Assignment 8.

Write a brief (~1-2 paragraph) summary of the main thesis of the article.  What is the author's message?
How do you suppose the article may relate to programming?


This article discusses the use of lists as a memory aid and infection
fighting tool in intensive care unit. The article argues (persuasively,
in my opinion) that giving doctors and nurses lists of things to do when
taking care of a patient in an ICU helps the rate of survival and of
line infections noticeably. By implementing these list, we could save
more lives than the vast majority of current medical research.

The article, seemingly distant from the topic of programming, puts an
emphasis on precision and exactness. Computers, (especially imperative
languages) are precise to a fault and never deviate from the checklist
of things we have told the computer to do. Also, when something goes
wrong in a program, you have to check everything that could go wrong to
see where it did go wrong.
