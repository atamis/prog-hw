What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Failed to get Tetrix working.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
None.

If you created anything new, what was it?
Almost made Tetrix. Also started writing a game engine from scratch. I'm
working with raw pixel buffers, implementing my own game engine and
logic. So far, I've got a little selector moving around, I've got it
randomly generating galaxies with lots of star systems, naming each star
system, etc.. It currently finds the closest system, and displays its
name, coordinates, and orbiting objects. I also implemented a font
drawing system and drew my own font. It's pretty cool.

What new questions or goals do you have?
I can't wait to get to lambdas.

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
Only that building anything other than Tetris would have been easier. I
have never had so much trouble with a bug like that. It might be the
tools I'm working with (I'm unused to the debugging system, and the
inabiity to use print debugging, my most used method, is almost
crippling.)

What was good about this week?
We no longer have to work on tetrix.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Nothing.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
Nothing.

Do you have any other comments?
Tetris. :(
