What did you do in class? How did you make use of your time?
  In class I completed homework, and when I was done with that, I
  rewrote my RPN parser so that it didn't use nasty side effects. It
  used to use a global array with some functions to simulate a stack.
  Now, it shares pases the stack along when it recurses.
What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
  I had never heard a function being called AN-OPERATION before, but
  other than that, there were no new words.
If you created anything new, what was it?
  I rewrote the RPN parser, but that isn't strictly speaking new.
What new questions or goals do you have?
  I can't wait until we get to functions.
What was good about this week?
  It was pretty easy. Homework was easy, inclass was easy, etc.
What would you like to change–what can you do better?
  I might be able to help other students, but none of them seemed to
  need it (not that I was looking very hard) and none of them asked.
What would you like me to change–what can I, the teacher, do better?
  Nothing yet.
Do you have any other comments?
