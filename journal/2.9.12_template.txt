What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
I worked with Raphie on assignments. 

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
I ran into quaternions in jMonkeyEngine. Didn't understand them.

If you created anything new, what was it?
Started building a basic game engine for a space game.

What new questions or goals do you have?
I want to build more games.

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
I'm not sure. I haven't played Ur'quan Masters yet.

What was good about this week?
Raphie wasn't stupid.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Move even faster.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
Assign more games. They're much funner to build than anything else.

Do you have any other comments?
I'm tired of using BSLwLA. Also, if we're going to write a game, I'd
like to write it in standard Racket to aleviate the accurate-innacurate
performance problem I ran into with PONG.
