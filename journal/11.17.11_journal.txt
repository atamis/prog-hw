What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Did homework, played around a little.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Nothing new.

If you created anything new, what was it?
Nothing new, but I made the friction in my UFO thing more realistic. Instead of
subtracting a set amount of speed each tick, it would multiply the vector speed
by a constant (0.9, or so) repeatedly. This made the UFO slow down, and also set
a top speed above which the UFO doesn't go (this is because the increase in
speed is outstripped by the friction).

What new questions or goals do you have?
Nothing really.

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
I had an idea for a clock that instead of a clock face just has some bars going
across from left to right. I don't know about using FrTime, but I now I would
use an actual measure of seconds after epoch, not counting from when the program
was started.

What was good about this week?
No homework.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
I could go even faster.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
More ideas?

Do you have any other comments?
Nope.
