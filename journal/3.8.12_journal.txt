What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
I worked on the arrangements assignment and the abstract functions
question.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Nothing.

If you created anything new, what was it?
I've been working a game-thing tentatively called spacegamecraft
(another excellent name) in Java.

What new questions or goals do you have?
Get to anonymous functions faster.

Did this week's studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
Not really.

What was good about this week?
Finally finished the arrangement assignment.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Nothing. I am flawless.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
More anonymous functions.

Do you have any other comments?
I'm wondering how to structure the actual game part of the Java game. I
could use the racket big-bang theory, but I get the feeling that, while
it'll work in Java, it won't be as efficient and may result in some code
bloat. My previous games have used a stack-based system where you push
or pop a state to move forward or back between menu systems and the
game. This works okay, but it's not quite what I'm looking for, and I
was wondering if you had any advice.
