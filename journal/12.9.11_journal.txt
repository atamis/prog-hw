What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Worked on assignments.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Nothing

If you created anything new, what was it?
Nothing really

What new questions or goals do you have?
No goals

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
They didn't give me the idea, but I am intrigued by the web site
downloader. I think the solution for now is to simply run an http server
when I want to view the site. Messing about with relative and absolute
paths is hard, and getting it right would be tricky. I might want to add
it later, but for now, nope.

What was good about this week?
We finally got to structs.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
No, I am perfect.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
Nothing.

Do you have any other comments?
I really should have used #s to represent notes in the notes assignment.
However, there's no point it rewriting half my code to use numbers
instead of letters. I get the feeling that implementing sharps and flats
might be easier with numbers rather than letters.
