What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Worked on the digraph and 8 queen problems.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Digraph was a new term for something I already understood.

If you created anything new, what was it?
I'd like to say that my solution to the queens problem is is something new, but
I got a lot of (accidental) help from Chris, and I basically copied his
algorithm.

What new questions or goals do you have?
Nothing really.

Did this week's studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
Not really. I could pretty easily adapt my queen soln program into a bishop or
rook soln program. That might be interesting.

What was good about this week?
Problems were relatively challenging.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Nothing.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
Nothing.

Do you have any other comments?
Nope.
