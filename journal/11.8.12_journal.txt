What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Worked on the compiler, which was a little confusing.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
I wasn't entirely sure what alpha equivalency was. Still not really
sure, but I know enough to write the function. It has something to do
with variable names not mattering, or changing, or something. 

If you created anything new, what was it?
Pass 1 of the compiler.

What new questions or goals do you have?
None.

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
Not really.

What was good about this week?
Nothing in particular.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Nothing.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
Nothing.


Do you have any other comments?
Nope.
