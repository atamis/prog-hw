What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Worked on pass 6.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Nothing actually new in pass 6, but it's some of the hardest recursion
I've ever had to write. Rivals anything you set us, even the generative
recursion. Raphie's having a tough time as well, but I'm not sure how our
confusion compares.

If you created anything new, what was it? 
Wrote the easy parts of pass 6.

What new questions or goals do you have?
Why is pass 6 so difficult? Isn't all this checking of safeness and
unsafeness premature optomization, which is the root of all evil?

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
THis wekk is so absurdly specialized, I don't think I could apply
these lessons to anything else.

What was good about this week?
Tough pass.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Nothing.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
Nothing.

Do you have any other comments?
Nope.
