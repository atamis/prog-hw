What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
I worked on tetris in class with Raphie.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Nothing.

If you created anything new, what was it?
Still working on tetris. I am working on a different game, but right now
it's just a weird pixel buffer system. I have built a font system on top
of the pixel buffer system, and drew my own font, but it looks sort of
strange, which is to be expected, I suppose.

What new questions or goals do you have?
Build some kind of game on this super simple engine.

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
I've been think of some kind of space game. Ideally, it would include
complex economic modeling and AI with cool emergent economic activities,
but that sounds like a LOT of work in a field I really just don't know
anything about.

What was good about this week?
Short week.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Write more code outside of class. Have a good idea for a game.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?


Do you have any other comments?
Netbeans doesn't install on my machine, so I have to use eclipse >.>
