What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Worked on pong.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Renaming cons to aq was devious, but didn't save any characters.

If you created anything new, what was it?
I've almost created pong, but that doesn't really count as new.

What new questions or goals do you have?
None.

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
Not really.

What was good about this week?
Lots of time to work on pong, a project with few teacher imposed
parameters, where almost every aspect of the internal design was
dictated by me.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Nothing.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
Nothing. Pong was fun. Perhaps more projects like pong?

Do you have any other comments?
Maybe it's something in my code, but Pong seems a little slow. The
paddles start jerking around when you hold the keys down, and there have
been times when I've had to kill the evaluation thread from DrRacket. I
hesitate to think what would think when both paddles and a ball are
moving. Maybe I'm doing something stupid, making more drawing calls than
I need to, storing data inefficiently, making inefficient calculations,
or something. Either way, performance is lacking to a worrying degree,
to the point that the game might be unplayable.
