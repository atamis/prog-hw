What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
I worked on assignments.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
I hadn't thought of currying as a separate function, only as an integral
part of Haskell. That was new.

If you created anything new, what was it?
Just assignment stuff.

What new questions or goals do you have?
I'm interested in Haskell again. I keep wondering if I should build
something big in it, but then I realize that I'd probably overreach and
become discouraged. That being said, I think that the class should cover
either C or Haskell next, though there's a good chance we won't get that
far.

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
I keep thinking about how crappy email is as a communication medium, and
how much better it could be. Then I realize that nothing anybody will
ever create (within at least 5-10 years) will ever replace email.

What was good about this week?
When I'm not working with Raphie on the small assignments, I'm quite
fast.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
Do more programming outside class. It's just a little depressing.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?
I was waiting for you to tell us to write map and fold[l|r] for
Ancestor. I was a little disappointed you didn't tell us to. But not
disappointed enough to write it on my own and incorporate it into my
submission.

Do you have any other comments?
As languages go, this style of Racket isn't particularly space
efficient. What with comments and tests, it's not uncommon to reach
hundreds of lines of code for each assignment. This is particularly
noticeable in the largest assignments like games and such.
