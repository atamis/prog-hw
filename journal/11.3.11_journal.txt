Learned about cond and did homework. Also played around with
build-image.

I added a few color-related features to draw, and created some
interesting shapes with build-image.

What new questions or goals do you have?


Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?


What was good about this week?
Playing with color was cool, but it was easy when dealing with color to
make it look harsh.

What would you like to change-what can you do better?
I can do homework even faster.

What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?


Do you have any other comments?
Racket itself doesn't convert well between floats and integers. Even
round, which claims to convert, doesn't and taht produced problems when
dealing with colors. Sine waves didn't work very well.
