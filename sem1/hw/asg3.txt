  surrounded by ""s.
What main characteristic does a literal have?
  It's just itself, it will never be anything else, unlike identifiers.
Do Exercise 3.4.4 on p. 39.
  ellipse : number(width) number(height) string(mode) string(color) -> image
  circle : number string(mode) string(color) -> image
  triangle : number string(mode) string(color) -> image
  star-polygon : number(side-length) number(side-count) number(step-count) -> image
What must a contract (also known as a signature) contain?
  <function name> : <argument types, labeleled when confusion is likely> -> <result>
What is a comment?
  Some text or expressions in a program that is not interpreted as code.
What common practical uses of comments does the author describe?
  Disabling parts of the code and writing down function contracts.
Bonus: Exercise 3.3.7.
  (define side-length 10)

  (overlay/align "middle" "top"
    (rotate-180 (triangle side-length "solid" "orange")) 
    (rectangle side-length (* side-length (/ (sqrt 3) 2)) "solid" "blue"))
