What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
  I generally just listened, did homework, and did the programming
  equivalent of doodling when bored.
What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
  I had no idea what an inventory was.
If you created anything new, what was it?
  The concept of an inventory inside the function body is a strange one.
  Java (and ruby, and proabbly some other languages) stick that sort of
  stuff in the function header.
What new questions or goals do you have?
  I want to work on Project Euler in Racket, and eventually in Haskell.
Did this week's studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
  I built a centralized strobe light simulator in Node.js. A computer
  can access a form and control, the speed and color pattern of webpages
  on other computers, typically for a harsh strobing effect during
  dances. Unfortunetly, when you have multiple computers running the
  strobe, they aren't in sync. I've been looking into Now.js to solve
  this problem, but it might require a larger rewrite than I'd like. so
  I guess we'll have out of sync strobe lights for now
What was good about this week?
What would you like to change–what can you do better?
What would you like me to change–what can I, the teacher, do better?
Do you have any other comments?
