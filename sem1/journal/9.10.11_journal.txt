What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
  I made use of my time in class working on things assigned in class.
What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
  The difference between identifiers and variables is subtle.
If you created anything new, what was it?
  I made a recursive function that deals with curves, but that's not
  very interesting
What new questions or goals do you have?
  No new questions, but I now want to learn Haskell.
Did this week's studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
  MORE RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
What was good about this week?
  The "replicate the image" project was cool.
What would you like to change–what can you do better?
  I could read the reading more attentively.
What would you like me to change–what can I, the teacher, do better?
  I realize images are good teaching tools, but images lead to source
  files thousands of lines long for even the smallest programs :(.
Do you have any other comments?
