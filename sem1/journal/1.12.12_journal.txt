What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
Worked on PONG and assignment 30.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
Certain kinds of recursive list processing functions were really
confusing. Accumulating functions make more sense to me.

If you created anything new, what was it?
PONG.

What new questions or goals do you have?
How can I understand recursive list processing functions better? What is
the "proper" way to write them?

Did this weekâ€™s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
Perhaps some other game that doesn't require such real time processing
power as PONG.

What was good about this week?


What would you like to change-what can you do better?


What would you like me to change-what can I, the teacher, do better?


Do you have any other comments?
