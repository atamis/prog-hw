What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
  Finished homework or worked with other people.
What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
  The difference between arguments and parameters, that was subtle.
If you created anything new, what was it?
  I've made some small functions (my invalidate function was the first
  finished, unless somebody was quietly faster.)
What new questions or goals do you have?
  I'm now determined to learn Haskell, but that's for the far future.
Did this week's studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
  It got me looking at the complex documentation for big-bang, which
  could, of course, be used to make a game, which is probably what
  we'll be doing at some point. A visual version of Casting SPELs might
  be useful, though a graph rather than a tree using the shared syntax
  in racket would be cool
What was good about this week?
  Got to work with other people. Got to learn about animate. It reminds
  me of Processing, but, of course, with a different syntax.
What would you like to change–what can you do better?
  When I was programming with Brian, I probably helped a little too
  much, it was more like I was instructing him where and what to type
  because he wasn't sure where where to put various expressions.
What would you like me to change–what can I, the teacher, do better?
Do you have any other comments?
  I find pair programming mildly annoying. There I was, laying down
  expressions and functions, and then we had to switch, and I suddenly
  got the feeling that a strange improv game, and as soon as I let go of
  the keyboard, the program would get horribly mangled by the
  introduction of another into the creative process. I guess the way to
  solve this is to involve my partner more fully during my time at the
  keyboard; to make sure he understands where I want the program to go
  and to make sure we are in agreement.
