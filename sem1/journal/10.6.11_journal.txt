What did you do in class this week? How did you make use of your time?
I mostly worked on homework.

What words and concepts were new to you this week, and what do they mean?
I started looking into futures, but not very hard.

If you created anything new, what was it?
The proportional bar graph, and I played around with the Fibonacci function.

What new questions or goals do you have?
I want to see how well skills applied in Racket transfer to Clojure and web 
development in that language.

Did this week’s studies give you any ideas of things you could create?
A bar graph function that takes a list (or is a macro) that will produce bar
graphs with an arbitrary number of bars.

What was good about this week?
It wasn't terrible.

What would you like to change–what can you do better?
I forgot to expand the function. I mean, we don't expand built in
functions...

What would you like me to change–what can I, the teacher, do better?

Do you have any other comments?
No
